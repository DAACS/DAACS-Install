                "content": "<h2>Mastery Orientation</h2>\n\n<p>Goal orientation refers to the reasons people engage in learning. Two types of goal orientation include mastery orientation and performance orientation. People with a <strong>mastery orientation</strong> want to master skills and gain knowledge. In contrast, people with a <strong>performance orientation</strong> want to perform well so they appear intelligent or capable to others. Most people have a combination of both types of goal orientation, but good learners tend to be more mastery oriented. </p>\n\n<p>The scenario below illustrates the distinction between mastery orientation and the less adaptive performance orientation.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Janet and Rick are classmates in an Introductory Psychology course. With the midterm exam just a week away, both learners are spending a lot of time studying, but for very different reasons. Rick thinks, &ldquo;This material is fascinating, and I really want to master the basics so that I can take a more advanced course next semester.&rdquo; [mastery orientation] Janet, on the other hand, says to herself, &ldquo;I better do well on this exam so that I don&#39;t come across as dumb or stupid.&rdquo; [performance orientation]</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The distinction bewteen a mastery and performance orientation may seem like a very minor thing, but it is actually quite important.

With the first exam of the semester approaching in one week, Sam reminded himself that he needed to study this new material. He sat down to study, but soon received a text from his friends inviting him to play basketball. Since the exam was a week away, Sam figured that he could play basketball that night and could study later; after all, it was important to stay in touch with friends and get exercise, too. As the week progressed, Sam got involved with assignments for other classes and more basketball games, and neglected to study for the math exam until two nights before the test. He decided to study each chapter that would be tested, and began to read the first one. The night before the test, Sam realized he had  finished only one of the four chapters, and the only way he could cover all the material was if he stayed up all night. Sam barely slept.

He was so tired during the test that he could hardly think. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Sam realized he should have spaced out his studying over the course of the week, and set specific days and times to devote to his studies.
